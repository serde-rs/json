### FEATURES #################################################################

[features]
default = [ "std" ]

# Use a different representation for the map type of serde_json::Value.
# This allows data to be read into a Value and written back to a JSON string
# while preserving the order of map keys in the input.
preserve_order = ["indexmap"]

# Use an arbitrary precision number representation for serde_json::Number. This
# allows JSON numbers of arbitrary size/precision to be read into a Number and
# written back to a JSON string without loss of precision.
arbitrary_precision = []

# Provide a RawValue type that can hold unprocessed JSON during deserialization.
raw_value = []

# Provide a method disable_recursion_limit to parse arbitrarily deep JSON
# structures without any consideration for overflowing the stack. When using
# this feature, you will want to provide some other way to protect against stack
# overflows, such as by wrapping your Deserializer in the dynamically growing
# stack adapter provided by the serde_stacker crate. Additionally you will need
# to be careful around other recursive operations on the parsed result which may
# overflow the stack after deserialization has completed, including, but not
# limited to, Display and Debug and Drop impls.
unbounded_depth = []

# enable std support (enabled by default)
